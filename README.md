## The apps I created when learning React

## Apps Summary

- **components:** Using functional [components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) and props to implement a part of a blog (the comments part).
- **seasons:** Using the class based [components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html), [state and lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) to implement Geolocation Api and displaying the weather according to the region where the user live.
	> **Points of interest:**
	>- Geolocation.getCurrentPosition() [method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/getCurrentPosition) to get  the current position of the device.
	>- using [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) for styling.
- **pics:** Using of the React [event handling](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) and [Refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) for the installation of an API which allows to filter and display the searched images.
	> **Points of interest:**
